Medea is a Progressive Web Application  for Media Streaming
### About 
**Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** technology bring apps hat are built using Web technologies closer to native apps. Deployment of Web apps across devices is eased, because of standardized APIs.

For example, on mobile platforms (e.g. iOS or Android) PWAs can be added to the home screen with the help of Web App Manifests; on Windows, PWAs can be submitted to the Microsoft Store. Using Service Workers API and Indexed DB, offline playback capability can be enabled. Performance can be improved with the help of Web Workers.

Research and develop download and offline playback functionality for adaptive streams
Test in different browsers and devices
